# Markdown to CS letterhead

1. Customize your name, address, etc in `_preamble.tex`.
2. Write `letter.md` in markdown. You don't need a salutation or closing.
3. Run `./build letter.md`. You'll get `letter.pdf`.

## Further customization

This is forked from [Ben Liblit's repo](https://github.com/liblit/uw-cs-letterhead). See its README for more detailed customization available by modifying the LaTeX sources.
